# image-recognition-project-nikitac 

This project is based on face detection API from Clarifai (https://www.clarifai.com/)
In this React App you just have to enter the URL of any Image/face and u will get that detected image.
And also those images recognized will be counted and will display the entry counts.

For BackEnd , I have used Node.js and Express.js(a framework of node.js) .
